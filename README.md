## About
LetsCheck, an online platform that lets users check claims circulating on Twitter about the coronavirus against reputable scientific sources or news media outlets.

Fight fake news with the new LetsCheck platform: The LetsCheck website showing the results of a userâ€™s search.
In an age where information can be disseminated quickly through social media, it is easy to communicate with our loved ones, and share stories that inspire. Yet, it is through these same channels that fake news and falsehoods can also spread, especially during the current uncertain times where we are bombarded by a multitude of reports aboutCOVID-19.

To help people verify claims surrounding COVID-19, the NUS Centre for Trusted Internet and Community (CTIC) has developed LetsCheck, an online platform that lets users check claims circulating on Twitter about the coronavirus against reputable scientific sources or news media outlets.

LetsCheck was launched on 31 August by NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye during a webinar jointly organised by CTIC and the NUS Institute of Data Science.
